Notes:
-> Do not run cam without lappy on charge

Steps:
Stuff to launch on the robot - 
Start Estop 
Tmux start
roslaunch /etc/ros/robot.launch c2:=false
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0.015 0 0 0 0 head_mount_kinect_ir_link camera_link 10
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch
tmux end
Switch to client
sudo ntpdate -u 10.68.0.1 (syncs clocks)
source ~/catkin_ws/tmux_robot_expts.sh
Launch cam driver (0,0)
launch cam filter (1,0)
launch rqt reconfigure
sc_nodelet -> depth_mode=hybrid (once per pr2 roscore launch)
launch rviz for verifying the point clound filtering
 sc frame -> sc_depth_frame
robot -> base_footprint



### Calibration Notes:
- Before you begin calibration, delete the pickle files in shield_perception/data_dump/calib_data_runs
- Once you have the camera driver and filter running, you can go ahead and through balls but make sure you run track_ball ros package
- track_ball will generate a pickle file per throw
- get around 10 throws
- now go to the scripts folder
- run python3 p3_calibrate.py to run the calibration which will generate perception_params.py file
